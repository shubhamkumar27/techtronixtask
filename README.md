In this task we have to decode the HEX code sent by any remote's IR sender by using an IR reciever and arduino board.

In this repository there are two things:
 1) A folder of name IRremote which is a library folder having required files. You have to copy this folder to the library location of 
     Arduino IDE and paste it there.
 2) An ino file or arduino code which has code written for the task.
